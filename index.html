                The gender gap in STEM remains significant, with women and
                non-binary people accounting for the minority in senior career
                positions. <br /><br />If women are not given equal
                opportunities, it is not on women to change themselves or
                conform, rather society itself needs to change. Blackwell's
                mention of the need for society to be remodelled prompts us all
                to question the structures, as well as our own thoughts and
                actions, that may be limiting women's progress. Through WiNUK we
                hope to encourage this thinking across our audience of men,
                women and gender non-conforming individuals so that collectively
                we can improve our working environments to enable
                neuroscientists to flourish regardless of their gender identity.

            <strong>Gap Year:</strong>Finally, after your degree, you could take
            a gap year, where you could work another job that isn’t necessarily
            neuroscience-related to save money, and if costs allow, you could
            volunteer and/or travel. <br /><br />
            If you have intrusive thoughts while doing this, remember that we
            all have our own rhythm for achieving goals and it’s a privilege to
            be able to explore our opportunities and the world when we have the
            time to, which is more often the case early in our careers.

              into the daily lives of neuroscientists, providing valuable
              insights for postgraduate applications, and delving into the
              intricacies of equity in neuroscience, our social media posts have
              resonated with individuals from diverse backgrounds and stages of
              life, united by a shared commitment to gender equity in the field.
              <br /><br />
              A special acknowledgement is due to our dedicated social media
              team, content creators, and graphics team for their tireless

              The last week of April was MS Awareness Week. MS
              disproportionately affects women, highlighting the need for
              research to focus on sex differences in neurological diseases. We
              shared educational content during the week as well as an
              informative video on our TikTok.

                designating 2024 as the global year for recognition of sex
                disparities in pain, we will have a series of posts on our
                socials. We will explore why chronic pain is such a global
                burden, our reliance on opioids and address the ‘Gender Pain
